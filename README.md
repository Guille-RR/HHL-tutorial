# HHL-tutorial
This is the repository created for the assignment of the lecture of Machine Learning and Quantum Computers of the UIMP Quantum Technologies master degree. The quantum linear solver package from qiskit is deprecated so I had to clone the repository locally and execute it. This repository is contained in the following link: https://github.com/anedumla/quantum_linear_solvers
